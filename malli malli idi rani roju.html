    <p>Mallli Malli Idhi Rani Roju (translated as Again, this is a Queen's Day) is a 2015 Telugu romantic drama film directed by K. N. T. Sastry. The movie stars Sumanth and Nithya Menen in the lead roles. The film explores themes of love, relationships, and the passage of time.

        The story centers around the lives of two individuals, Gautham (played by Sumanth) and Rani (played by Nithya Menen). Gautham is a young man who becomes infatuated with Rani, a woman who is a traditional, strong, and independent character. The film alternates between two timelines: one where Gautham is a young man in his early 20s, and the other where he is a more mature man, looking back at his life and the decisions he made regarding Rani.</p>
