    <p>*Endhukantey Premanta* (translated as "Why is it Love?") is a 2011 Telugu romantic drama film directed by Karunakaran. The movie features Sushanth and Samantha Ruth Prabhu in the lead roles.

            The plot revolves around the love story of Aravind (played by Sushanth) and Priya (played by Samantha). Aravind is a carefree, happy-go-lucky young man who enjoys life without much thought for the future. Priya, on the other hand, is a disciplined and idealistic woman who dreams of a perfect life. The two cross paths in college, and though initially they are from different worlds, they begin to form a deep emotional connection.
            
            As their relationship progresses, both face challenges that test their feelings and commitments. Aravind’s carefree attitude contrasts with Priya’s idealism, and the film explores the complexities of their relationship, the difficulties of balancing love with personal goals, and the emotional growth they undergo through the ups and downs.
            
            The movie is known for its light-hearted yet emotional storyline, capturing the nuances of modern-day relationships. The music, composed by Anup Rubens, also plays a significant role in conveying the romantic atmosphere of the movie.
            
            *Endhukantey Premanta* is a story about love, personal growth, and the compromises and sacrifices people make for the people they care about.</p>
