    <p>"Thandel" is a 2025 Telugu-language romantic action drama directed by Chandoo Mondeti, featuring Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi in the lead roles. The film is inspired by a real-life incident from 2018, where a fisherman from Srikakulam was captured by Pakistani forces in international waters.
        
        The story follows Raju (Naga Chaitanya), a fisherman deeply in love with Satya (Sai Pallavi). Despite Satya's plea for him to abandon the sea and seek other employment, Raju ventures out and accidentally drifts into Pakistani waters, leading to his arrest. The narrative explores the challenges Raju faces in captivity and his longing to reunite with Satya.
